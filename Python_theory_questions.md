# Python Basic to advanced question :-

## → What is Python, and its key features?
✅ Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
It is widely used in web development, automation, data analysis, machine learning, scripting, and more.

Where Python Shines
✅ Automation and Scripting (e.g., database jobs, system tasks)

✅ Data Analysis & Visualization (e.g., with pandas, matplotlib)

✅ Web Development (e.g., Flask, Django)

✅ Machine Learning & AI (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn)

✅ REST APIs & Integration

🧱 Python Built-in Data Types

| Category        | Type        | Description                               | Example                         |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Numeric**     | `int`       | Integer values                            | `x = 10`                         |
|                 | `float`     | Floating-point (decimal) numbers          | `y = 3.14`                       |
|                 | `complex`   | Complex numbers                           | `z = 2 + 3j`                     |
| **Text**        | `str`       | Sequence of Unicode characters            | `name = "Alice"`                |
| **Sequence**    | `list`      | Ordered, mutable collection               | `nums = [1, 2, 3]`              |
|                 | `tuple`     | Ordered, immutable collection             | `t = (1, 2, 3)`                 |
|                 | `range`     | Sequence of numbers                       | `r = range(5)`                  |
| **Mapping**     | `dict`      | Key-value pairs                           | `person = {"name": "Raj"}`      |
| **Set**         | `set`       | Unordered, unique items                   | `s = {1, 2, 3}`                 |
|                 | `frozenset` | Immutable set                             | `fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`     |
| **Boolean**     | `bool`      | Logical value (`True` or `False`)         | `is_valid = True`              |
| **None Type**   | `NoneType`  | Represents absence of a value             | `value = None`                 |
